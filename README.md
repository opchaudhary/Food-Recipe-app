## Project Overview

The Food Recipe App is a web application designed to help users discover, explore, and save recipes based on their preferences. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can search for recipes, view details including ingredients and instructions, mark recipes as favorites, and keep track of their search history. Here's an overview of the main features.

Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes using keywords such as ingredients, dish names, or dietary preferences. The app fetches relevant recipes from an external API and displays them in a visually appealing manner.

Recipe Details: Upon selecting a recipe, users can view detailed information about it, including a high-quality image, list of ingredients, cooking instructions, total preparation time, and serving size.

Favorite Recipes: Users can mark recipes as favorites to save them for later reference. Favorited recipes are stored locally or on a server, allowing users to access them from any device.

Search History: The app maintains a search history, allowing users to quickly revisit previous searches. Users can click on past searches to instantly retrieve relevant recipes.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and accessible across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The layout adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience.
